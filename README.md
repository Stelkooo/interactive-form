## About The Project

![Interactive Form Screen Shot](https://github.com/Stelkooo/interactive-form/blob/main/img/screenshot.png)

In this Treehouse project, I used JS to enhance a registration form by adding interactivity to it and through customised and conditional behaviours

Also user input is validated and helpful error messages are provided whenever an form field is filled with invalid information when they press the submit button

To further enhance the interactivity of this form, real time input validation is added to the name, email, and card input fields as well as the card input fields have real time conditional error messages which let the user know why the field is not yet valid

### Built With

- JavaScript
- Regular Expressions
- String Manipulation
- Form Validation
